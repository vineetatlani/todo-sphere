## **Project Introduction**

Todoshpere is a social media app that allows users to create todos and posts, and comment on posts. This project includes APIs for authentication, user management, todo management, post management, and comment management.

## **Features**

**Authentication:** Users can authenticate by sending a POST request with an email and password in the request body. Passwords are stored in the database with encrypted values. JWT authentication is used for user authorization, and tokens can be refreshed by the login API.

**User Management:** Users can be managed by sending HTTP requests to create, read, update, and delete user data. Admin can also edit other user details.

_Note_: A default admin user is automatically added when the server is started. The email and password of the default admin user can be modified through the configuration file **default.json**. An admin user can edit other user details, and only an admin can see or update the roles of a user.Â 

**Todo Management:** Todos can be managed by sending HTTP requests to create, read, update, and delete todo data.

**Post Management:** Posts can be managed by sending HTTP requests to create, read, update, and delete post data.

**Comment Management:** Comments can be managed by sending HTTP requests to create, read, update, and delete comment data.

**Caching:** Caching has been implemented for the users and posts GET APIs using the npm package memory-cache. However, caching could also have been done through Redis, which would improve performance and scalability.

**Mongodb Indexing:** Indexing has been done on different fields in MongoDB to improve query performance.

**Rate-Limiting:** Rate-limiting has been implemented to prevent abuse of the APIs.

**Postman Collection:** A Postman collection is included in the GitHub repository for easy API testing.

## **Setup**

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the dependencies by running **npm install**.
3.  Create a .env file in the root folder based on .env_example, set up values of the variables based on example
5.  Start the server by running **npm start**.

## **API Documentation**

This documentation outlines the API endpoints available for managing users on TodoSphere. Please use Postman collection for testing Apis

### **Base URL**

**http://todosphere.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com**

## **Authentication**

Authentication is required to access the all API endpoints exception creating user and login. A valid JWT token must be included in the **Authorization** header of each request.

Authentication can be done using the **/login** endpoint. A POST request is sent to the endpoint with a JSON body containing **strategy**, **email** and **password**. For authentication with email and password, strategy should be set as "local"
